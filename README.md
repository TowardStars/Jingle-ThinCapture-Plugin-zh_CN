## Compile/Build yourself
- Clone the repo and open in intellij
- `Settings` -> `Build, Execution, Deployment` -> `Build Tools` -> `Gradle` -> `Build and run using: IntelliJ Idea`
- Then open Gradle tab on the right, `Tasks` -> `Build` -> `build`
- This should generate a .jar file in the libs folder of the cloned repo, drag that into the plugins folder of Jingle.
